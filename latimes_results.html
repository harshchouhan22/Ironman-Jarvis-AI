      <td>Earthquakes and climate change threaten California dams</td>
      <td>Earthquakes remain a threat to California's aging dams, but experts say extreme weather due to climate change will pose new risks.</td>
      <td>It was a harrowing vision of the vulnerability of aging California dams — crews laboring feverishly to sandbag and drain the lower San Fernando Reservoir, as billions of gallons of Los Angeles drinking water lapped at the edge of a crumbling, earthquake-damaged embankment that threatened catastrophe on the neighborhoods below. Although the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and the near failure of the Lower Van Norman Dam have given rise to construction improvements — the much newer Los Angeles Dam survived an equivalent shaking in the 1994 Northridge quake — the overwhelming majority of California dams are decades past their design life span. And while earthquakes still loom as the greatest threat to California's massive collection of dams, experts warn that these aging structures will be challenged further by a new and emerging hazard: “whiplashing shifts” in extreme weather due to climate change. “The biggest issue facing dam safety in California is aging infrastructure and lack of money to fund repairs and retrofits of dams," said Sharon K. Tapia, who leads the Division of Safety of Dams at the California Department of Water Resources. "Many older dams were built using construction methods considered outdated by today’s standards." Federal engineers have found that three major dams in Southern California — Whittier Narrows, Prado and Mojave River — are structurally unsafe and could collapse in a significant flood event and potentially inundate millions of people downstream. Each has been reclassified as “high urgency structures” amid growing concerns that they were designed and built on 20th century assumptions and hydrological records that did not anticipate the region being hit more frequently by storms that were previously regarded as once-in-a-lifetime events. “Even if engineers had made risk assessments that were accurate at the time these structures were built, they aren’t accurate now, and won’t be anymore due to climate change,” said Daniel Swain, a UCLA climatologist. These extreme weather events compound problems posed by earthquakes, which are inherently unpredictable and can cause safety problems that remain hidden or hard to identify. Such was the case when the San Fernando, or Sylmar, quake struck before dawn 50 years ago this week and nearly collapsed the Lower Van Norman Dam in Granada Hills. The 1,100-foot dam, which began construction in 1912, held 3.6 billion gallons of water on the morning of Feb. 9, 1971. Due to earthquake concerns identified five years earlier, the reservoir was ordered to be kept below full capacity, and on that morning the water level measured 36 feet below the lip of the dam. The top 30 feet of the rolled earth dam crumbled and sank into the reservoir, leaving the water only six feet from the top with fresh chunks of earth falling off with each aftershock. Not since 1925, when a 6.8-magnitude quake destroyed the Sheffield Dam and sent 30 million gallons of water coursing through Santa Barbara, had California faced such a seismic-related crisis. Authorities ordered the evacuation of 80,000 people living below the dam in an area bounded by the San Diego Freeway on the east, Victory Boulevard on the south, Balboa Boulevard on the west and Rinaldi Street on the north. Engineers spent the next three days pumping water from the dam through a 24-inch hole cut in an aqueduct pipe. Scientists later estimated that collapse of the dam would have killed as many as 123,400 people. The brush with catastrophe prompted seismic reevaluations and retrofits of dams throughout the state, most of them built for a 50-year life span. The average age of a California dam, state dam safety officials say, is 70. Today, about 75% of the 1,250 dams regulated by the state Department of Safety of Dams are more than 50 years old. In addition, 250 are classified as “extremely high hazard,” indicating that their failure or misoperation is expected to result in loss of life and economic damage. A scenario published by the U.S. Geological Survey warns that a rare mega-storm, or what experts call an Arkstorm, could last for weeks, causing structural and economic damage that would amount to $725 billion statewide. Until only recently, it was thought that a flood of the magnitude similar to the one that hit California during the rainy season of 1861-62 and dropped 36 inches of rain on Los Angeles, could only occur every 1,000 to 10,000 years. Recent studies, however, suggest that the chances of seeing another flood of that size over the next 40 years are about 50-50. Now, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ top priorities in Southern California include spending an estimated $600 million to upgrade the 62-year-old Whittier Narrows Dam, built in a natural gap in the hills about 11 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The earthen dam was placed in the agency’s highest risk category when it determined three potential failure modes threatened more than 1 million people downstream from Pico Rivera to Long Beach. They included the premature opening of the San Gabriel River Spillway gates, erosion resulting from water piping through the foundation of the dam and overtopping during an extreme flood event. Federal engineers say that while the first would result in downstream flooding, the latter two could result in catastrophic failure of a structure built to rein in one of the steepest rivers in the U.S. From its boulder-strewn forks in the San Gabriel Mountains, the river plunges some 9,900 feet to Irwindale. The modifications to prevent the dam from failing if overtopped include placing roller-compacted concrete on the crest and downstream slope of the embankment and improving the seepage control system with trench drains and other features. The project is expected to be completed by 2026, officials said, with environmental monitoring extending through 2031. In 2019, the Army Corps determined that a significant flood event could compromise the concrete slab of the spillway of the 80-year-old Prado Dam on the Santa Ana River, potentially flooding an estimated 1.4 million people in dozens of Orange County communities from Disneyland to Newport Beach. Untamed, the Santa Ana River has been as fickle as it has been destructive. It took what has been called the “storm of the century” in March of 1938 to spur action. Devastating rains lashed Southern California, leaving 119 people dead, 2,000 homeless and 68,400 acres under water, and bringing President Roosevelt west to survey the wreckage. Prado Dam, located next to the 91 Freeway on the border of Riverside and Orange counties, was originally designed to control a flood 2½ times the size of the 1938 inundation. The risk factor for the 50-year-old Mojave River Dam protecting the high desert communities of Victorville, Hesperia, Apple Valley and Barstow was heightened from “low” to “high urgency action” in 2019 because of “performance concerns.” Federal engineers say failure of the 200-foot-tall earthen dam on the northern flanks of the San Bernardino Mountains could send water rushing down the Mojave River channel, inundating 16,000 people and $1.5 billion in property as far as Baker, more than 100 miles northwest. The Army Corps is evaluating risk-reduction measures including hardening the dam to prevent erosion and collapse if water flows over the top. The lessons of dam vulnerabilities are often written in lost lives and economic devastation. One of California’s worst disasters was the collapse of the St. Francis Dam in northern Los Angeles County on March 12, 1928. Its failure prompted the creation of the California Dam Safety Program. A muddy wall of water as high as 70 feet carved a 70-mile path of destruction in a 5½-hour rampage from San Francisquito Canyon to the Pacific Ocean near Oxnard, killing more than 450 people. More than 900 buildings were destroyed, 300 heavily damaged and almost 24,000 acres of agricultural land were washed away. The dam was full to the spillway from spring rains when two sides of the 700-foot-long dam collapsed, spewing out 12 billion gallons of water. A state commission reported the dam failed because it was poorly constructed and located on a geologically unstable site. The Baldwin Hills Reservoir, which was constructed by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, was not subject to state safety oversight when nearly 250 million gallons of water burst through its northern wall in late 1963. Five people were killed and $15 million in property damages occurred as a result of the breach, which was attributed to subsidence beneath the dam that allowed water to seep into the shear zones in the underlying rock causing erosion to worsen rapidly. The clues to the spillway failure at Oroville Dam in 2017, however, were embedded deep in the record files and unrecognized by officials before the structure broke apart. A chronicle of problems when the spillway was used — cracking in the concrete surface and unexpectedly large amounts of water exiting drains under the deck — suggested something was wrong. But annual inspections gave the state false confidence that the spillway could handle a big flood event. On Feb. 7, 2017, the concrete spillway of the 700-foot-tall dam fell apart during the release of water after heavy rains. The erosion of its emergency spillway, which was basically a hill of dirt that federal engineers believed would rarely, if ever, be used, triggered the evacuation of more than 180,000 people. The head of the California Water Resources Department, which operates the dam, was removed after an independent probe found the failure was the result of a lax safety culture. “Emerging data of massive simulations of flooding suggest that existing flood control systems are a ticking time bomb,” said Brett Sanders, a professor of civil engineering at UC Irvine. “Southern California, in particular, is completely unprepared to deal with the consequences.” “Once the water goes outside of the structures intended to rein it in, it will go everywhere,” he said, “and there will be little time to get out of its way.” “Unfortunately, much of the ongoing research is focused on climate change and engineering strategies,” he added. “We ought to start spending more time studying the potential catastrophic risks to working-class communities in the floodplains."</td>

      <td>Elon Musk's Bitcoin embrace is a bit of a head-scratcher</td>
      <td>The Tesla CEO says climate change is a threat to humanity, but his endorsement is driving demand for a cryptocurrency with a massive carbon footprint.</td>
      <td>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has long maintained his purpose in life is to improve the prospects for humanity's long-term survival — by colonizing other planets, building technology to keep artificial intelligence under human control and, above all, accelerating the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Tesla's core mission, repeated countless times by Musk, is "to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy." He once told Rolling Stone, “Climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI." But lately, Musk seems distracted by another calling: the prospect of making huge piles of money quickly through financial speculation. In recent weeks, he’s been pumping enthusiasm for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on Twitter, and the more he talks, the higher the prices climb. On Monday, Bitcoin rose more than 20% to an all-time high of $47,550 on the news that Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency and plans to accept it as payment for its electric cars. It was the currency's second Musk-related bump in as many weeks. On Jan. 29, Bitcoin's price shot up 20% after he added "#bitcoin" to his Twitter bio. It's since been removed. Tesla did not say whether Musk has been trading in cryptocurrencies. While Musk is ever predictably unpredictable, there are reasons to be surprised at his public enthusiasm for Bitcoin, or at least of making his electric car company the vehicle for it. One is the volatility. Cryptocurrency values have been subject to sharp rises and sudden crashes, adding significant risk to Tesla’s cash accounts. Today a Bitcoin is worth about $47,000; in March, it was about $5,000. “The danger of holding cash in Bitcoin is that you’ll have to take an earnings hit if the value goes down but can’t recognize an earnings boost if it goes up,” said Francine McKenna, publisher of the accounting and audit newsletter, the Dig. Cryptocurrency is “a roller coaster I would not think most investors want to ride,” she said. Tesla has struggled to score a profit in some quarters, with credits from selling emissions credits accounting for the vast majority of positive earnings while the core automotive sales business remains a profit drag. A Bitcoin crash could make it even harder for Tesla to eke out quarterly profits, she said. Beyond financial considerations, there's the question of how promoting and profiting from Bitcoin squares with Tesla's stated mission, the advancement of sustainable energy, given the enormous amounts of electricity required to support the computing power involved. A study published by science journal Joule said cryptocurrency computers pumped about 23 megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2018. Much of that is due to so-called cryptocurrency mining, in which massive banks of computers are used to solve the math equations that yield new coins. That's attracted miners worldwide, many in regions mainly dependent on coal for electricity, although Iceland, where electricity is generated by cheap, clean hydropower, has become a center for cryptocurrency mining. Those crypto-emissions are equivalent to the CO2 spewed by well over 4 million gas-powered cars each year. (According to U.S. government statistics, a typical internal combustion passenger vehicle emits 4.6 metric tons per year.) The environmental issues sparked some backlash on Twitter. "Are ESG funds still able to invest ... after this?" said Harper Reed, an entrepreneur who helped Barack Obama win the presidency as the campaign's chief technology officer. ESG stands for environmental, social and corporate governance, a hot new category for mutual fund and exchange traded fund investing. Musk took heat last month for his fight against a Texas oil company over rights to drill natural gas near a SpaceX rocket testing facility in southern Texas. Methane, a greenhouse gas that traps far more heat than an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide, is a component of the fuel used in SpaceX's Raptor rocket engines. For years, Musk has been criticized by environmentalists for his frequent flights on private Gulfstream 550 and 650 jets. The 550 burns about 400 gallons of fuel per hour; the 650 burns about 450 gallons. On Monday evening, Musk announced via Twitter more details on his contest to come up with the best carbon capture technology for a top prize of $100 million. Bitcoin isn't the only speculative investment Musk has thrown his weight behind lately. Tweets from his account appearing to cheerlead for GameStop stock and the digital currency Dogecoin elicited sharp rises in the prices of each.</td>

      <td>Biden wants 100% clean energy. Will California step up?</td>
      <td>Policymakers are looking to California to show it's possible to phase out fossil fuels. But, as rolling blackouts last summer showed, challenges lie ahead.</td>
      <td>The undersea power line would run south from San Luis Obispo County, hugging the California coast for 200 miles before making landfall in or near Los Angeles. It would be able to carry electricity from a fleet of offshore wind turbines, providing Southern California with clean power after sundown and helping to replace fossil-fueled generators. Fewer planet-warming emissions, less risk of blackouts, and no chance of igniting the wildfires sometimes sparked by traditional power lines: Those are the arguments for the $1.9-billion Pacific Transmission Expansion. Yet state officials haven't shown much interest. To understand why, you need to look beyond the sheen of California's impressive climate targets and navigate the labyrinth of cautious regulators and bureaucratic silos that critics say are stifling badly needed clean energy infrastructure — and will keep doing so unless Gov. Gavin Newsom demands greater urgency. Policymakers across the country are looking to California to show that it's possible to phase out fossil fuels. State law mandates 100% clean energy by 2045, and until recently, things seemed to be going well. Nearly two-thirds of California's electricity came from climate-friendly sources in 2019, against the backdrop of a growing pre-pandemic economy. Two evenings of rolling blackouts in August 2020 offered a warning of more challenging times ahead. In a recent report examining what went wrong, state officials cast some of the blame on themselves. They said they had failed to require enough energy resources that could keep power flowing to air conditioners on hot summer evenings, after solar panels go dark. Now they're scrambling to avoid additional outages next summer, in part by extending the life of climate-polluting natural gas plants that otherwise would have shut down. But even if California skates by without rolling blackouts in 2021, there's a clear longer-term need for clean energy sources that can be relied on when electricity demand is high and there's not enough sunlight to go around. That's where climate activists and renewable-power companies worry that Newsom's administration is setting up the Golden State for failure. "The state is essentially sowing the seeds for the next crisis," said Danielle Osborn Mills, California director for the American Clean Power Assn., an industry trade group. Strong ocean breezes off the California coast blow more consistently than onshore winds and stay strong into the evening, making them a potentially valuable complement to solar farms. Other after-dark clean energy options include geothermal plants that tap into Earth's subterranean heat and lithium-ion batteries that can store solar power for use in the evening. The California Public Utilities Commission has begun pushing utility companies to invest in batteries but has largely ignored other technologies, even though there's widespread agreement that batteries alone won't be enough to phase out fossil fuels. Power plants fueled by natural gas and coal are only one slice of California's contribution to climate change, with cars and trucks making up the biggest share of emissions. But cleaning up transportation will depend on a power grid big enough to support millions of electric vehicles, with enough transmission lines and renewable-energy generators to meet the influx of demand. So climate advocates were frustrated when the Public Utilities Commission set a target last year of reducing emissions from power plants by just 25% by 2030 — a slower pace than emissions fell during the previous decade. The California Independent System Operator, which oversees the power grid, described the 2030 target as inadequate for meeting the state's climate goals. Despite that criticism, the utilities commission unanimously approved a proposal Thursday that made its 2030 target the basis for approving or rejecting new transmission lines, such as the undersea cable. That's a big deal because transmission is crucial for connecting renewable-energy facilities such as solar and wind farms with cities that consume large amounts of electricity — and permitting and building new power lines is an arduous process that can take as long as a decade. If the commission doesn't plan for enough new transmission today, climate advocates say, Californians in 2030 could find themselves still hooked on natural gas — or, if more gas plants shut down, facing heightened risk of blackouts. "The accountability is lacking at this agency, and yet they are the linchpin of California meeting its climate goals," said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. Commission staff say they must tread carefully before compelling utilities to build new infrastructure because projects such as the $1.9-billion undersea cable are paid for by utility customers through their electric bills. Ed Randolph, who leads the commission's energy division, said transmission costs accounted for one-fifth of ratepayer bills. Those costs have risen sharply over the last decade — 17% at Southern California Edison, 14% at San Diego Gas & Electric and 10% at Pacific Gas & Electric, according to an April 2020 report. And they're likely to keep going up, with the three companies planning to spend $15 billion over the next two years to reduce the risk of wildfire ignitions from their infrastructure. In an interview last summer — shortly after the state barely avoided a second round of rolling blackouts amid an intense heat wave — Randolph said his agency was forecasting electric rate increases of 20% to 40% over the next three years. If energy bills rise too quickly, he predicted, there could be a "ratepayer revolt" that derails California's climate goals. "You’ll get to a point where people won’t want to buy an electric vehicle because it will be cheaper to power a car with gasoline," he said. "People won’t want to buy electric hot water heaters for their homes because boiling natural gas is clearly cheaper." Yet the Independent System Operator — the agency responsible for initiating rolling blackouts when the need arises, as it did in August — has continued to criticize the utilities commission's clean energy infrastructure planning as so insufficient that it may undermine California's ability to avoid blackouts and achieve its ambitious climate goals. Part of the grid operator's concern is the looming retirement of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, the state's largest electricity generator. It's scheduled to start shutting down in 2024, and huge amounts of new resources will be needed to replace it. The undersea cable to Los Angeles isn't designed as a replacement for Diablo Canyon. But it would plug into the electric grid at the site of the nuclear plant. It would most likely carry power generated by offshore wind turbines or by solar farms paired with batteries in the San Joaquin Valley, where some farmers are turning to solar development as water supplies dwindle. Either option could help the Los Angeles Basin phase out gas plants that spew not only carbon dioxide but also toxic pollutants, contributing to unhealthy air quality in low-income neighborhoods with many Latino and Black residents. "We don’t have to close gas plants tomorrow. But we have to plan," said Robert Mitchell, co-founder of Three Rivers Energy Development, the company behind the Pacific Transmission Expansion. An advantage of undersea transmission is that Mitchell's company wouldn't have to negotiate agreements with hundreds of landowners along the project route, one of the main reasons land-based power lines can take so long to complete. But there would still be hurdles. California zealously guards its coastline as a treasured public space and a safe harbor for marine life. Mitchell's power line would be buried via an installation process that he says would have little impact on ocean life, and there are already fiber optic cables across the seafloor. But the Coastal Commission would no doubt have questions, as would fishermen and environmental activists. "There is so much unknown in terms of impacts on habitat, the environment, fishing grounds and marine wildlife in general," Mike Conroy, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Assns., said in an email. Some environmental activists have also raised concerns about offshore wind turbines — as has the military, which says the towering structures could interfere with training exercises. There are currently no wind farms off the U.S. West Coast, despite enormous energy potential. The East Coast already has two wind farms, with more planned. "We’re very frustrated with the lack of serious planning for offshore wind in California," said Nancy Rader, executive director of the California Wind Energy Assn., an industry trade group. "We're just banging our head against the wall." There's little question offshore wind will eventually be needed — it's just a matter of how much, and how soon. A draft report released by the California Energy Commission, the Public Utilities Commission and the Air Resources Board in December concluded that the cheapest path to 100% clean energy involved building 10 gigawatts of offshore wind — more than four times as much power as the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant generates. And that may be a lowball figure, considering the agencies capped offshore wind at just 10 gigawatts in their models despite a technical potential more than 10 times that amount. Wind energy developers say there are advantages to moving quickly. They note that the government spending bill passed by Congress in December allows offshore-wind projects to qualify for a 30% federal investment tax credit — but only if they begin construction by 2025. Utility ratepayers could lose out on energy bill savings if developers can't get started by then, although it's possible falling technology costs would make up some of the difference. The Biden administration's climate plans are another consideration. President Biden campaigned on a goal of 100% clean power by 2035, a decade earlier than California's current mandate. Analysts at the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie say meeting the new president's lofty ambition would require "hockey-stick growth in offshore wind." Biden also promised to create millions of clean energy jobs — and organized labor sees offshore wind as a good fit. In an October letter to Newsom, John O'Rourke, a vice president at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, wrote that offshore-wind development would create thousands of high-skilled jobs. Undersea cables, he said, could help deliver that power to Los Angeles and other cities. He asked Newsom to "compel the California Public Utilities Commission to move forward now with direction on transmission planning, so the process for approval can begin in early 2021." In another letter last week, a coalition of environmentalists and renewable-energy trade groups — including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Large-Scale Solar Assn. — urged Newsom to "appoint thoughtful and committed leaders" to the Public Utilities Commission and other agencies, with a goal of speeding up climate action. They said the state is not on track to reach 100% clean energy by 2045, and that won't change without new direction. "Unfortunately, years of bureaucratic delay have caught up to us," they wrote. Asked about those letters, Newsom spokeswoman Erin Mellon said in an email that the governor had "emphasized the need to meet the state’s clean energy goals." She also noted California's role in launching a task force "to bring together state, local, federal agencies and tribal governments to advance offshore wind including to open up offshore lease areas." Newsom moved aggressively in another climate arena in September, ordering regulators to ban the sale of oil-powered cars by 2035. That followed his pledge to "fast-track" the state's climate efforts after a summer of recording-breaking fires. But climate advocates say the governor must play a more active role in infrastructure decisions being made a lot sooner than 2035 — in part because of the fragmented nature of the bureaucracy responsible for those decisions. For an example of what that fragmentation looks like, take the transmission corridor known as Path 26. It's a key electrical highway connecting Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, with wires that run from an Edison substation north of Los Angeles to a PG&E facility west of Bakersfield. The wires are increasingly "congested," meaning there's often more demand to send electricity through them than Path 26 can handle. The result is that it's costlier and more difficult for renewable-energy companies to send power south to the Los Angeles Basin, potentially limiting development of offshore-wind farms and solar-plus-battery projects in the San Joaquin Valley. Upgrading Path 26 would help relieve the congestion. Building an undersea cable is another option. But officials at the Independent System Operator "haven't seen a credible business case to justify spending any material amount of money" on either of those options, said Neil Millar, the agency's vice president of infrastructure development. And why is that? Because the grid operator can only approve transmission projects that meet an energy need identified by the Public Utilities Commission — and the commission has thus far assumed that L.A. Basin gas plants will continue to operate. Public Utilities Commission staff say there's still room to ship additional clean energy around the state via existing wires, at least for now. They're working on plans to replace Diablo Canyon, and they disagree with the grid operator's gloomy predictions about what might happen if they don't push for a faster infrastructure build-out. As for new types of clean energy that can fill the gap when the sun isn't shining — such as offshore wind or geothermal — commission staff don't foresee much need for them until after 2030, meaning there's still time to get started on new transmission. "Even in the most conservative timeline that we need to build transmission, it's further out than where we are right now," said Randolph, the agency's energy division chief. Commission staff made some last-minute changes to their contested transmission-planning proposal before Thursday's vote, acknowledging that some geothermal will be needed and that emissions probably will have to come down faster than they've previously assumed. They say they'll have an opportunity to adopt a more ambitious plan as soon as next year. Randolph said there was "both an art and a science" to piecing together the puzzle of 100% clean energy. If elected officials have different ideas about how fast the state needs to move, he suggested, they should tell regulators what they want done. The planet is warming, and the clock is ticking. Although 2045 may seem like a long way off, 24 years isn't much time in the life of the power grid. For better or worse, the decisions California makes today could reverberate for decades.</td>
